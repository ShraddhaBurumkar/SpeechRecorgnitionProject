# SpeechRecorgnitionProject
This project has the Speech-To-Text Converter and Speech Synthesizing capabilities it in not a complete replacement of what we call a NOTEPAD but still a good text editor to be used through voice. This software also can open windows-based software such as Notepad, MS-Paint and more. 
Speech-To-Text Converter/Software can translate spoken words into text using closed captions to enable a person with hearing loss to understand what others are saying. Speech Recognition can also enable those with limited use of their hands to work with computers, using voice commands instead of typing.
It enables hand-free control of various devices and equipment provides input to automatic translation and creates Print-Ready dictation.
Among the earliest applications for speech recognition were automated telephone systems and medical dictation software.
Some other ways people use speech recognition is to play their music hand free, print document, record audio, get updates on whether condition, make travel arrangement, find cooking recipes and much moreâ€¦
